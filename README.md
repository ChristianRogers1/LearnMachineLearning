# NLP-Models-and-Learning
Contains all of the code made for my self-taught NLP curriculum, as well as the resources I used

The goal of this repo is twofold:
    1. Compile high-quality resources, assignments, and examples for any future students of the school of self-learning
    2. Portfolio and documentation of my learning process

Full credit to [Ana MarasoviÄ‡](https://www.anamarasovic.com/) for the lecture slides, challenge ideas, and paper compilation. If you are reading this, I really appreciate your publicizing of all of these resources; they have been a great help to many students.
