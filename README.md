# NLP-Models-and-Learning
Contains all of the code made for my self-taught ML curriculum, as well as the resources I used

The goal of this repo is twofold:
    1. Compile high-quality resources, assignments, and examples for any future students of the school of self-learning
    2. Portfolio and documentation of my learning process
