# NLP-Models-and-Learning
Contains all of the code made for my self-taught NLP curriculum, as well as the resources I used

Full credit to [Ana MarasoviÄ‡](https://www.anamarasovic.com/) for the lecture slides, challenge ideas, and paper compilation. If you are reading this, I really do appreciate your publicization of all of these resources, they have been a great help to a great many students.
